# Turtle Crossing Game

A simple turtle crossing game was implemented using the turtle graphics module in Python.

## Description

The Turtle Crossing Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a turtle and tries to cross a busy road without colliding with cars. The game features a turtle that moves vertically on the screen, cars moving horizontally from right to left, and a scoreboard to track the player's score. The player earns points for successfully crossing the road and loses the game if they collide with a car.
